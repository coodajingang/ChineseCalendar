<h1>Reconstruction of Calendars in the Qin and Early Han Dynasties (221 BCE &ndash; 104 BCE)</h1>
<p>First draft: April, 2019</p>
    <br />
<p>On this webpage, I describe the method used to reconstruct the calendar used in the Qin and Early Han dynasties, covering the period from 221 BCE to 104 BCE. The reconstruction method is claimed to be valid from 246 BCE to 104 BCE, but we only use it for the period from 221 BCE to 104 BCE. The reconstruction method is based on the paper "Researches on Calendars from Qin to early Han (246 B.C. to 104 B.C.) &mdash; centering on excavated calendrical bamboo slips"<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Li2012">Li12</a></sup> by L&#464; Zh&#333;ngl&#237;n (see also his book <i>On the Calendric System of the Qin and Early Han Dynasties</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Li2016">Li16</a></sup>). The gist of the reconstruction method is to divide the time interval between 245 BCE and 104 BCE into three periods. Lunar conjunctions in each period are calculated based on the <a href="guliuli.html#sifenSystem"><i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system</a>. The only difference between the three periods is the epoch of the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, which can be regarded as a free parameter in the system used to compute the lunar conjunction times. The 24 solar terms are computed in the same way as the Zhuanxu calendar, one of the <a href="guliuli.html">ancient six calendars</a>. The intercalary (leap) months are inserted following a 3-3-3-2-3-3-2 pattern in a 19-year (<i>zh&#257;ng</i>) cycle discussed on our <a href="guliuli.html#runyu">ancient six calendars page</a>. According to L&#464;, this is just an empirical rule used at that time and has nothing to do with the 24 solar terms, a viewpoint not shared by most scholars. I don't fully agree with him either and think the issue requires further study. However, I will not discuss the issue here as it's not directly related to the reconstruction method.</p>
    
<p>The reconstruction method relies heavily on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, which is discussed in detail on our <a href="guliuli.html">ancient six calendars page</a> and will not be repeated here.</p>

<sect id="introduction">Introduction</sect>
    
<p>The calendrical system used in the Qin and Early Han dynasties (221 BCE &ndash; 104 BCE) has been puzzled by scholars in the past centuries. According to <i>Sh&#464;j&#236;</i> (&#21490;&#35352; or <i>Records of the Scribe</i>), the calendar used by the early Han dynasty was the same as that of the Qin dynasty (221 BCE &ndash; 207 BCE). <i>H&#224;nsh&#363;</i> (&#28450;&#26360; or <i>Book of Han</i>) further explains that the calendar used by the Qin dynasty was the Zhuanxu calendar, one of the <a href="guliuli.html">ancient six calendars</a> believed to have been used in the Warring States period (480 BCE &ndash; 222 BCE). However, it has been known for a long time that the dates computed by the Zhuanxu calendar do not agree with the dates appeared in the historical documents. They match more closely with those computed by the Yin calendar, another one of the ancient six calendars. Scholars from the 11th century to 20th century thought that the Qin and Han calendar was either the Zhuanxu calendar or the Yin calendar. However, an archeological discovery in 1972 shattered this view.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">**************************</p>
<p>Before I go on, it is useful to introduce a notation to label the years in the Chinese calendar. Even though a Chinese year does not coincide with a year in the Western calendar, it is possible to establish a simple mapping from a Chinese year to a Western year. This is because the Chinese calendar is a luni-solar calendar. The average number of days in the calendar is close to a tropical year. Therefore, there is no secular drift between the years in the Chinese calendar and Western calendar. Hereafter, I use the notation <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span> to denote the Chinese year whose New Year day is closest to Jan. 1 of the Western year y. For example, <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-100</sub></span> refers to the Chinese year whose New Year day was closest to Jan. 1, <span class="nowrap">-100</span> (101 BCE). It turns out the New Year day of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-100</sub></span> was on Feb. 19, <span class="nowrap">-100</span> in the proleptic Julian calendar, and the last day of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-100</sub></span> was on Feb. 7, <span class="nowrap">-99</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">**************************</p>
<p>In 1972, bamboo slips were excavated from Y&#237;nqu&#232;sh&#257;n (&#37504;&#38592;&#23665;) in Sh&#257;nd&#333;ng province in eastern China. The bamboo slips contain a calendar table for the year <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span>, providing very valuable information on how months and days were arranged in that year. The calendar table lists the sexagenary names of the first days in each month. The year <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> had 13 months, with a leap month placed at the end of the year. Of the 13 sexagenary dates for the 13 months, only 7 of them match those calculated by the Zhuanxu calendar and 10 of them match those calculated by the Yin calendar. This means that the calendar used in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> was neither the Zhuanxu calendar nor Yin calendar. Historians and astronomers were excited by this discovery and attempted to figure out what system the calendar was based on.</p>
    
<p>Even though the calendar in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> was not one of the ancient six calendars, it is generally believed that the calendar in that period was still based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system. It is also clear from the excavated calendar table, as well as historical documents, that the month order of the calendar at that time was the same as the Zhuanxu calendar, in which the first month of a year began with month 10, followed by month 11, month 12, month 1, ..., month 9. A leap month was placed at the end of a year after month 9 and was called post month 9 (&#24460;&#20061;&#26376;). The problem is that there are many ways to construct a calendar based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system that matches all the data in the excavated calendar table. In Section 3.9 of the book <i>Ancient Chinese Calendars and Almanacs</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#ZCBH2008">ZCBH08</a></sup> and in the paper "An  Attempt  to Discuss  the  Calendrics  of  the  Qin  and  Early  Han  According  to Newly Excavated Calendars on Slips and Boards"<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Zhang2007">Zhang07</a></sup>, Zh&#257;ng P&#233;iy&#250; states that there are 58 possible ways of reproducing the calendar dates in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system. The maximum deviation of the lunar conjunction times between these 58 systems is 87 minutes. Many scholars proposed their own methods of reconstructing the calendar around that period. Without new data, it was impossible to tell which of these methods was correct.</p> 
    
<p>New data did appear thanks to archeological discoveries in the 1980s and early 2000s. More calendrical bamboo slips were excavated from two tombs, covering years from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-185</sub></span>, and several years between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-244</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-208</sub></span>. These new data indicate that the calendar between 245 BCE and 104 BCE was more complicated than previously thought. They suggest that the calendar in the Qin dynasty (before 206 BCE) was based on a different system from the calendar in early Han dynasty around 200 BCE, and the calendar used in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> was based on a system different from the other two. None of the previous reconstruction methods proposed to fit the <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> data matches all the new data.</p>
    
<p>I know of two papers attempting to find methods to reconstruct the calendar in this period based on all the available data<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#fn1">fn1</a></sup>. One is the paper by Zh&#257;ng P&#233;iy&#250; in 2007 mentioned above<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Zhang2007">Zhang07</a></sup>. The other is "Researches on Calendars from Qin to early Han (246 BCE to 104 BCE) &mdash; centering on excavated calendrical bamboo slips"<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Li2012">Li12</a></sup> by L&#464; Zh&#333;ngl&#237;n in 2012.  This research has also been incorporated in his book <i>On the Calendric System of the Qin and Early Han Dynasties</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Li2016">Li16</a></sup> published in 2016. I thank Prof. L&#464; Zh&#333;ngl&#237;n for sending me his book. The proposed reconstruction methods by these two authors are not the same, even though they all fit the available data.</p>
    
<p>Zh&#257;ng proposes two reconstruction methods, one for the calendar in the Qin dynasty (before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-205</sub></span>), and the other for the early Han dynasty until 104 BCE. The method for the Qin calendar is based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system with the epoch at the time when the lunar conjunction and the solar term Z9 were assumed to both occur at midnight on Oct. 27, 607 BCE. Intercalation was determined by the requirement that the solar term Z10 was always in month 10 (solar term labels are given on our <a href="solarTerms.html">solar terms page</a>). The conjunction dates associated with all months in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> &ndash; <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-206</sub></span> are listed in Table 9 at the end of the paper.</p>
    
<p>For the early Han calendar, Zh&#257;ng concludes that it is impossible to find a calendar based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system that can fit all the data. In other words, if the calendar used in the early Han was based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, there must be some changes during the period. If there was no change in the calendar, it could not be based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system. Zh&#257;ng decides to give up the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system and finds another system that fits the data. His reconstruction method is to adopt a lunar cycle of (29 + 663/1249) days, and a solar cycle of 365.2496734 days or (365 + 311.8420766/1249) days. The seeming strange number for the solar cycle comes from the 235:19 ratio between the solar and lunar cycles. The solar cycle can also be written as (365 + 5925/23731) days. The 235:19 ratio is chosen to enforce the 19-year (<i>zh&#257;ng</i>) cycle. Zh&#257;ng does not specify an epoch for the reconstruction method, but he provides the conjunction dates associated with all months in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-205</sub></span> &ndash; <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span> in Table 10 at the end of the paper<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#fn2">fn2</a></sup>. The paper doesn't mention what intercalation rule is used. Zh&#257;ng mentions an intercalation rule for another reconstruction method (which is inferior since it doesn't match all the data), which is the requirement of the solar term J1 always being in month 1. This is a very strange rule as it clearly doesn't fit the data. I am able to reproduce his Table 10 using the intercalation rule mentioned in Section 3.9 of the book <i>Ancient Chinese Calendars and Almanacs</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#ZCBH2008">ZCBH08</a></sup>. The rule is to require the winter solstice to be in month 11 for the years before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>, and to require the solar term Z1 to be in month 1 for the years after <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>.</p>
    
<p>Zh&#257;ng's use of a non-<i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system is similar to the method he used to reconstruct the Chunqiu calendar used by the Lu state in the Spring and Autumn period (this website adopts his reconstruction method of the Chunqiu calendar and the method is explained on our <a href="chunqiu.html">Chunqiu calendar page</a>). He doesn't provide any reason as to why this is a good approach. I think it is only a model designed to fit the data, and not likely to be the actual rule used in the early Han period.</p>
    
<p>Now let's turn to L&#464; Zh&#333;ngl&#237;n's approach. Since there is evidence to suggest that three different systems were used in the calendar dates on the bamboo slips, the simplest assumption is that the calendrical system was modified at least twice. L&#464; attempts to divide the time interval into three periods and use three different methods based on the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system to fit the data. He assumes that the 24 solar terms were calculated in the same way as in the Zhuanxu calendar. The only difference between the three methods is the epochs used to compute the lunar conjunctions. He names the epochs simply by A, B and C. Epoch A was at midnight on Nov. 18, 362 BCE. Epoch B was at midnight on Oct. 31, 241 BCE. Epoch C was at midnight on Dec. 14, 207 BCE. In all three cases, lunar conjunctions were assumed to have occurred at these epochs. Epoch A applies to the calendar in the period from circ. <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to month 12 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span>. Epoch B applies to the calendar in the period from month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span> to the end of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-163</sub></span>. Epoch C applies to the calendar in the period from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span> to month 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>.</p>
    
<p>L&#464; proposes that the leap months were inserted based on an empirical rule following a 3-3-3-2-3-3-2 pattern in a <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle. He points out in a paper published in 2009<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Li2009">Li09</a></sup> that all of the leap months between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span> can be deduced by the excavated calendrical bamboo slips and the available historical documents. As a result, it is not necessary to know the actual intercalation rules to reconstruct the calendar in this period. So I will not discuss the highly debated intercalation rules here.</p>
    
<p>Even though the reconstruction methods proposed by Zh&#257;ng and L&#464; are quite different, their discrepancies are quite small. Of the 140+ years between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span>, there were 1700+ lunar conjunctions and only 19 mismatches of the dates among these conjunctions between Zh&#257;ng's and L&#464;'s. The following table lists these 19 mismatches.</p>

<p>Since the reconstructed calendars of Zh&#257;ng and L&#464; both fit the available data and their differences are small, one can choose either of them to reconstruct the calendar between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span>. The calendar from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-220</sub></span> (or 221 BCE) to month 4 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> on this website is reconstructed using L&#464;'s method. The following sections describe the implementation.</p>
    
    <br />
<sect id="computation">Computation of Solar Terms and Conjunction</sect>
    
<p>The calculation of solar terms is the same as in the Zhuanxu calendar, which is described on the <a href="guliuli.html#computation">ancient six calendars page</a>. Here I only list the formulae. According to equation (4) and Table 2 on the <a href="guliuli.html#computation">ancient six calendars page</a>, the Julian day of the winter solstice closest to year y is given by<br />
JD(W(y)) = 1721050.5 + 19/32 + y&middot;P<sub>s</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<br />
where P<sub>s</sub> = 365.25 is the number of days in a solar cycle in the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system. The other solar terms can be calculated using equation (5) on the <a href="guliuli.html#computation">ancient six calendars page</a>:<br />
JD<sub>q</sub>(j, y) = JD(W(y)) + (j/24)&middot;P<sub>s</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)<br />
Here j is the solar-term number counting from the winter solstice, with j=0 for the winter solstice (Z11), j=1 for J12, j=2 for Z12, j=3 for J1, ..., j=23 for J11. With the exception of the winter solstice being in late December in year <span class="nowrap">y-1</span>, all other 23 solar terms computed using equation (2) are in year y.</p>
    
<p>The times of lunar conjunctions can be written in the form as in equation (1) on the <a href="guliuli.html#computation">ancient six calendars page</a>:<br />
JD(M<sub>i</sub>) = JD(M<sub>0</sub>) + i&middot; P<sub>L</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)<br />
Here P<sub>L</sub> = 29 + 499/940 is the number of days in a lunar cycle in the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, i is the lunation number from the conjunction <span class="nowrap">M<sub>0</sub></span> at the epoch, and <span class="nowrap">M<sub>i</sub></span> is the ith conjunction after <span class="nowrap">M<sub>0</sub></span>. </p>
    
<p>As stated in Introduction, three epochs are used for the calendar between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span>. These epochs are used only for the computation of lunar conjunctions. Take epoch A as an example, which assumes a lunar conjunction occurred at midnight on Nov. 18, 362 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar, corresponding to a Julian day number of 1589523.5. Hence we have <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>0</sub>)</span> = 1589523.5 for epoch A. Values of <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>0</sub>)</span> for the two epochs can be calculated or looked up from the dates in the proleptic Julian calendar. The following table summarizes the result.</p>

<p>If we know the number of lunations A(y) associated with the New Year day conjunction of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span> from the epoch conjunction <span class="nowrap">M<sub>0</sub></span>, the New Year day conjunction time can be computed using equation (3) with i replaced by A(y). Having computed the New Year day, the conjunctions associated with the other months in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span> can be computed by adding integer multiples of <span class="nowrap">P<sub>L</sub></span>. However, we need to know the leap months before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span> in order to compute the accumulated months A(y). Leap months and calculation of A(y) are discussed in the following section.</p>
    
    <br />
<sect id="leap">Leap Months and Accumulated Months</sect>
    
<p>As stated in Introduction, all of the leap months between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span> can be deduced from the excavated calendrical bamboo slips and available historical documents. We can therefore use these known leap months to calculate A(y) without relying on any particular intercalation rule. This is the approach adopted here.</p>
    
<p>The accumulated months A(y) can be calculated in the same way as described in the <a href="chunqiu.html#leapMons">Chunqiu calendar page</a>. The leap months in the Chunqiu calendar were irregular and so A(y) must be computed year by year based on the leap month information. By contrast, leap months between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span> followed the regular 3-3-3-2-3-3-2 pattern, but the leap-year cycle was interrupted after <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span> and the counting was reset to a different year of origin after that. It is therefore not necessary to calculate A(y) year by year. We only need the data in a <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle, which can be captured by two functions J and R defined in the following table.</p>

<p>Here k is the number of years from the beginning of a <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle: k=0 means the first year in the cycle, k=1 the second year, k=2 the third year, ..., k=18 the 19th (last) year. The value of J(k) is an indicator of whether or not the year has a leap month: J(k)=0 means no leap month, J(k)=1 means there is a leap month. The sequence 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 appearing in J(k) shown in the table is exactly the 3-3-3-2-3-3-2 pattern. The value of R(k) is the total number of months from the first month of a <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle. It begins with 0 at k=0, and increases by 12 or 13 each year: 12 if there is no leap month and 13 if there is a leap month. Hence, R(k) follows the recurrence formula<br />
R(0) = 0 &nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R(k)= R(k-1) + 12 + J(k-1) &nbsp;&nbsp; (k = 1, 2, 3, ..., 18) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)<br />
The values of R(k) in Table 3 are computed from this recurrence formula. Now that we have J and R, A(y) can be computed using the following equations.<br />
c = floor( (y - y<sub>z</sub>)/19 ) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)<br />
k = y - y<sub>z</sub> - 19c &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)<br />
Leap month: No leap month if J(k)=0, a leap month if J(k)=1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)<br />
Accumulated months: A(y) = &Delta;A + 235c + R(k) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)<br />
Here floor(x) denotes the largest integer smaller than or equal to x, <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> is the first year of a particular <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle. As mentioned above, the leap-year pattern was interrupted in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span> and the counting was reset to a different <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span>. Thus there are two different values of <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span>, one for years before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span> and the other for years after <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>. The variable c in equation (5) is the number of <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycles between <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> and the <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle the year y was in. The variable k in equation (6) is the number of years between year y and the beginning of its <i>zh&#257;ng</i> cycle. It can also be written as k = mod(y - <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span>, 19), where mod(X,Y) denotes the remainder of X divided by Y. The last two terms in equation (8) is the accumulated number of months between the first month of <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> and the first month of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span>, but A(y) is the accumulated months between the epoch conjunction <span class="nowrap">M<sub>0</sub></span> and the first month of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span>. So a correction term <span class="nowrap">&Delta;A</span> has to be included in equation (8). Values of <span class="nowrap">&Delta;A</span> and <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> for the three epochs are listed in the table below. Information from Table 2 is also listed for convenience. As mentioned above, <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> switches from one value to another after <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>, but <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span> is the first year when the epoch is switched to epoch C. So <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> is the same for epochs A and B, but changes to a different value for epoch C.</p>

<p>Calendars from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span> can be reconstructed using equations (1)&ndash;(3), (5)&ndash;(8), and Tables 2&ndash;4. Two examples are shown in the  next section to demonstrate the calendar calculation.</p>
    
<p>Even though the reconstruction method is claimed to be valid for calendars from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to month 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, our <a href="index.html">calendar page</a> uses this method from 221 BCE to month 4 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> and our <a href="table.html">calendar table page</a> uses this method from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-220</sub></span> to month 4 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> (the <a href="index.html">calendar page</a> is mainly based on the Western calendar and the <a href="table.html">calendar table page</a> is mainly based on the Chinese calendar). Starting in month 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, both pages use the data from the book <i>3500 Years of Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Zhang1997">Zhang97</a></sup>, which shows calendar data based on the T&#224;ich&#363; astronomical system (&#22826;&#21021;&#26310;) beginning in month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#fn4">fn4</a></sup>. In <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, month 3 had 29 days and month 4 should have had 30 days according to the reconstructed calendar. However, when the new calendar was used in month 5, the conjunction day moved one day earlier, turning month 4 into a short month. Month 5 was a short month in the new calendar. As a result, months 3, 4, 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> all had 29 days. This is impossible for any calendar based on the <i>p&#237;ngshu&#242;</i> rule (based on the mean motions of the Moon and Sun), and could only occur when switching to a new calendar. If the switch is changed to month 6, month 5 will have 28 days, which is also impossible under normal circumstances.</p>

<sect id="examples">Examples</sect>

<h3>Example 1: Calculate all months in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>, the dates and lunation fractions of the solar terms Z10, Z11 (winter solstice) and J1.</h3>
    
<p>Let's first calculate the months. From Table 4, epoch C should be used for <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>, <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>0</sub>)</span> = 1646163.5, <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> = -179 and <span class="nowrap">&Delta;A</span> = 321. It follows from equations (5)&ndash;(8) and Table 3 that<br />
c = floor( (-130 + 179)/19) = 2<br />
k = -130 + 179 - 19&times;2 = 11<br />
J(11) = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp; &rArr; &nbsp;&nbsp; no post month 9 (leap month) in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span><br />
A(-130) = 321 + 235&times;2 + 136 = 927.<br />
The Julian day of the month 10 conjunction time in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> was<br />
JD<sub>10</sub> = 1646163.5 + 927&times;(29+499/940) = 1673538.5 + 93/940<br />
This means the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the conjunction was 93 (omitting the denominator 940). In the 24-hour time system used today, this means the conjunction was at 2:22:28. The Julian day number at noon of the conjunction day was 1673539. Using the standard algorithm for converting Julian days to calendar dates (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day#Julian_or_Gregorian_calendar_from_Julian_day_number" target="_blank">algorithm by Richards</a>), the Julian day 1673539 corresponds to Nov. 25, 132 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar. According to the formulae for converting Julian days to sexagenary cycle names on our <a href="sexagenary.html">sexagenary cycle page</a>, the stem number of the sexagenary cycle on the conjunction day was<br />
1 + mod(1673539-1, 10) = 9，and the stem name was r&#233;n. The branch number was<br />
1 + mod(1673539+1, 12) = 9，and the branch name was sh&#275;n. So the sexagenary date was r&#233;n sh&#275;n.</p>
    
<p>The other conjunction times in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> can be computed by adding integer multiples of <span class="nowrap">P<sub>L</sub></span>. The traditional method is to use fractions to do the calculation. Take month 11 as an example. The month 10 conjunction was on Nov. 25, 132 BCE (sexagenary date r&#233;n sh&#275;n) and the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> was 93. The lunar cycle is (29 + 499/940) days. Adding 499 to 93 yields 592. Since the number is smaller than 940, the month 11 conjunction day was 29 days after the month 10 conjunction day and the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the month 11 conjunction was 592. Month 11 conjunction occurred on Nov. (25+29) = Dec. (25+29-30) = Dec. 24. The sexagenary date was 29 days after the r&#233;n sh&#275;n date. 29 = 30-1 = 2&times;12 + 5, so the stem name was one stem before r&#233;n (which was x&#299;n) and the branch name was 5 branches after sh&#275;n (which was ch&#466;u). The sexagenary date of month 11 conjunction was x&#299;n ch&#466;u. Of course, using Julian days to do the calculation is easier for implementation on a computer. The following table lists the dates of all months in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>.</p>

    <br />
<p>In the table, L means the month had 30 days and S means the month had 29 days. The number of days in a month is determined by the number of days between two successive conjunction dates. The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of a conjunction is the conjunction time from midnight expressed as a fraction of a day. The denominator 940 is often omitted. Since the lunar cycle is (29 + 499/940) days. The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of a conjunction increases by 499 (mod 940) every month. If the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> is smaller than 441, adding 499 to it will still be smaller than 940 and the number of days in the month is 29. If the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> is equal to or greater than 441, adding 499 to it will make the conjunction time at or past midnight, and the conjunction will be on the next day. There will be 30 days in the month in this case. </p>
    
<p>Now we calculate solar terms. Let's start with Z11 (winter solstice). It follows from equation (1) that the Julian day of Z11 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> was<br />
JD<sub>Z11</sub> = JD(W(-130)) = 1721050.5 + 19/32 -130&times;365.25 = 1673568.5 + 3/32.<br />
The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the winter solstice was <span class="nowrap">3/32</span>. The Julian day at noon on the solstice day was 1673569. Using the same conversion method as above, I get the Z11 day on Dec. 25, 132 BCE and the sexagenary date was r&#233;n y&#237;n. We can see from Table 5 that Z11 fell on the second day in month 11 in the Han calendar. As for the lunation fraction of Z11, it was the time difference between Z11 and its previous lunar conjunction expressed as a fraction of a lunar cycle. The lunar conjunction before Z11 was the month 11 conjunction and its Julian day was<br />
JD<sub>11</sub> = JD<sub>10</sub> + 29 + 499/940 = 1673567.5 + 592/940,<br />
lunation fraction of Z11 = (JD<sub>Z11</sub> - JD<sub>11</sub>)/(29 + 499/940) = 1163/74024 &approx; 0.3/19.<br />
I used fractions in the above calculations for convenience of showing the values of <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i>. All calendar calculations on this website use decimals, which is explained in the <a href="guliuli.html#decimals">last section</a> on the ancient six calendars page. The last formula on that page shows a convenient way of calculating the lunation fraction:<br />
L = (JD - JD(M<sub>0</sub>))/29.53085106382979 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9)<br />
lunation fraction of a solar term = L - floor(L) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10)<br />
where JD is the Julian day of the solar term and JD(M<sub>0</sub>) is the Julian day of the lunar conjunction at the epoch given in Table 2. The value of L is the time difference between the solar term and lunar conjunction at the epoch <span class="nowrap">M<sub>0</sub></span> in units of lunar cycles. The lunation fraction of a solar term is the time difference between the solar term and its previous lunar conjunction in units of lunar cycles, which is simply the fractional part of L. Take Z11 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> as an example. We have<br />
L = (JD<sub>Z11</sub> - 1646163.5)/29.53085106382979 = 928.0157111207177<br />
lunation fraction of Z11 =  L - floor(L) = 0.01571112207177 &approx; 0.3/19,<br />
which agrees with the calculation above. Since the Julian day of a lunar conjunction is an integer multiples of lunar cycles plus <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>0</sub>)</span>, we can use the Julian day of any conjunction to calculate L. We get a different integer part but the fractional part remains unchanged. Take <span class="nowrap">JD<sub>10</sub></span> as an example, we have<br />
L = (JD<sub>Z11</sub> - JD<sub>10</sub>)/29.53085106382979 = 1.015711120717605<br />
lunation fraction of Z11 =  L - floor(L) = 0.0157111220717605 &approx; 0.3/19,<br />
which also agrees with the above calculation.</p>
    
<p>It should be noted that the lunation fraction of the winter solstice is not an integer multiple of <span class="nowrap">1/19</span> as opposed to the case of many ancient six calendars. This is because there is no specified relationship between Z11 and the lunar conjunction at the epoch. Even in the Zhuanxu calendar, the conjunction and J1 were assumed to occur at midnight. Simple calculation shows that the lunation fraction of Z11 near the epoch was 69/152 = 8.625/19, which was also not an integer multiple of <span class="nowrap">1/19</span>. As there is no specified relationship between any solar term and lunar conjunction at epoch C, there is no reason for the lunation fraction of Z11 to be an integer multiple of <span class="nowrap">1/19</span>. The lunation fraction of any solar term increases by <span class="nowrap">7/19</span> (mod 1) every year. If it is not an integer multiple of <span class="nowrap">1/19</span> to begin with, it will never be in the subsequent years.</p>
    
<p>Next, we turn our attention to Z10. We can calculate it using equation (2), but Z10 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> should be in the year <span class="nowrap">-131</span>. So y=<span class="nowrap">-131</span> should be used in the calculation. In fact, we don't need to use equation (2) at all. Z10 was two solar terms before Z11, so we can simply subtract <span class="nowrap">(2/24)P<sub>s</sub></span> from Z11:<br />
JD<sub>Z10</sub> = JD<sub>Z10</sub> - (2/24)&times;365.25 = 1673537.5 + 21/32.<br />
Comparing JD<sub>Z10</sub> and JD<sub>10</sub>, we see that it fell on the day before the New Year day of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>. That was Nov. 24, 132 BCE. Z10 in 131 BCE must be on Nov. 24, 131 BCE, give or take one day. From Table 5, we see that the New Year day of <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-129</sub></span> was 30 days after Oct. 15, which was on Nov. 14, 131 BCE. This means that there was no Z10 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>.</p>
    
<p>Finally, let's compute J1, which was 3 solar terms after Z11. So<br />
JD<sub>J1</sub> = JD<sub>Z11</sub> + (3/24)&times;365.25 = 1673613.5 + 3/4, <br />
L = (JD<sub>J1</sub> - JD<sub>10</sub>)/(29 + 499/940) = 2 + 5198/9253, <br />
lunation fraction of J1 = 5198/9253 &approx; 10.7/19.<br />
The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of J1 was 3/4. The Julian day at noon on the day of J1 was 1673614. The corresponding date in the proleptic Julian calendar was Feb. 8, 131 BCE and the sexagenary date was d&#299;ng h&#224;i. From Table 5 we can deduce that it fell on the 17th day in month 12 in the Han calendar.</p>
    
    <br />
<h3>Example 2: Calculate all months in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span>, the dates and lunation fractions of the solar terms Z10, Z11 (winter solstice) and Z5 (summer solstice).</h3>
    
<p>From Table 4 we know that epoch A applies to the calendar before month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span> and epoch B applies to the calendar beginning in month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span>. So we need to calculate A(-201) for both epoch A and epoch B.</p>
    
<p>Let's do the calculation for epoch A first. From Table 4, we find <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>0</sub>)</span> = 1589523.5, <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span> = -225 and <span class="nowrap">&Delta;A</span> = 1670. Hence we have<br />
c = floor((-201 + 225)/19) = 1<br />
k = -201 + 225 - 19 = 5<br />
J(5) = 1, but epoch A is not valid after month 1. It is epoch B that determines if <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span> has a post month 9.<br />
A(-201) = 1670 + 235 + 61 = 1966<br />
JD<sub>10</sub> = 1589523.5 + 1966&times;(29+499/940) = 1647580.5 + 614/940.<br />
The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the New Year day conjunction was 614 (omitting the denominator 940). The Julian day at noon on the New Year day was 1647581. The  corresponding date in the proleptic Julian calendar was Oct. 31, 203 BCE and the sexagenary date was ji&#462; w&#468;.</p>
    
<p>As for epoch B, we have <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>0</sub>)</span>=1633701.5, <span class="nowrap">y<sub>z</sub></span>=-225 and <span class="nowrap">&Delta;A</span>=174 from Table 4. Hence,<br />
c = floor((-201 + 225)/19) = 1<br />

<p>As mentioned above, the number of days in a month may be determined by the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the conjunction. If the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> is smaller than 441, the month has 29 days; otherwise, the month has 30 days. However, this rule did not necessarily apply to month 12 because the conjunction of month 12 was calculated from epoch A and the conjunction of month 1 was calculated from epoch B. So the number of days in month 12 must be determined by the number of days between the two conjunctions.</p>
    
<p>The computation of solar terms is the same as above. Let's begin with the winter solstice (Z11). It follows from equation (1) that the Julian day of Z11 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-201</sub></span> is given by<br />
JD<sub>Z11</sub> = 1721050.5 + 19/32 - 201&times;365.25 = 1647635.5 + 11/32.<br />
The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> was 11/32. The Julian day at noon on the day of Z11 was 1647636. The corresponding date in the proleptic Julian calendar was Dec. 25, 203 BCE and the sexagenary day was j&#464; ch&#466;u. From Table 6, we can determine that Z11 fell on the 26th day in month 11 in the Han calendar. Since Z11 was earlier than month 1, we must use the conjunctions in epoch A to calculate the lunation fraction. We use <span class="nowrap">J<sub>10</sub></span> to do the calculation below:<br />
L = (JD<sub>Z11</sub> - J<sub>10</sub>)/(29 + 499/940) = 1 + 189201/222072, <br />
lunation fraction of Z11 = 189201/222072 &approx; 16.2/19.</p>
    
<p>Z10 was two solar terms before Z11, so<br />
JD<sub>Z10</sub> = JD<sub>Z11</sub> - (2/24)&times;365.25 = 1647604.5 + 29/32.<br />
The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> was 29/32. The Julian day at noon on the day of Z10 was 1647605. The corresponding date in the proleptic Julian calendar was Nov. 24, 203 BCE and the sexagenary day was w&#249; w&#468;. From Table 6, we can determine that Z10 fell on the 25th day in month 10 in the Han calendar. Since Z10 was in month 10, its lunation fraction can be directly computed using <span class="nowrap">J<sub>10</sub></span>.<br />
Lunation fraction of Z10 = (JD<sub>Z10</sub> - J<sub>10</sub>)/(29 + 499/940) = 182383/222072 &approx; 15.6/19.</p>
    
<p>The summer solstice (Z5) was half of solar cycle after the winter solstice. Hence,<br />
JD<sub>Z5</sub> = JD<sub>Z11</sub> + 365.25/2 = 1647817.5 + 31/32.<br />
The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> was 31/32. The Julian day at noon on the day of Z5 was 1647818. The corresponding date in the proleptic Julian calendar was June 25, 202 BCE and the sexagenary day was x&#299;n m&#462;o. From Table 6, we can see that the summer solstice fell on the second day in month 6 in the Han calendar. Since Z5 was after month 1, we need to use epoch B's conjunctions to calculate its lunation fraction. We use <span class="nowrap">JD<sub>1</sub></span> to do the calculation below.<br />
L = (JD<sub>Z5</sub> - JD<sub>1</sub>)/(29 + 499/940) = 5 + 9189/222072, <br />
lunation fraction of Z5 =  9189/222072 &approx; 0.8/19.</p>

<sect id="conjDiff">Time Lags of the Calendrical Conjunctions</sect>
    
<p>It is well known that the conjunction times determined by calendars in the Qin and Early Han dynasties were later than the astronomical conjunction times. The average of the time differences was about one day. This explains why the recorded solar eclipses in the early Han dynasty often occurred one day (and sometimes two days) before the calendrical conjunction days. The lunar cycle in the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system is slightly longer than the synodic month. The conjunction times would be one day later, on average, after about 300 years. This is why it's obvious from the figure below that the time lags of the calendrical conjunctions appear to increase steadily.</p>

JD is the Julian day of a calendrical conjunction <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>i</sub>)</span> calculated using equation (3) and then subtracts 0.3025 to convert it from the local time to the universal time UT1. The value of y may be regarded as the Julian year of the calendrical conjunction. The vertical red lines represent the times when epochs changed. From left to right, calendars in the three regions divided by the two red lines are calculated using epochs A, B and C. The vertical axis is the time lag of the calendrical conjunction<br /> 
<span class="nowrap">JD<sub>calendrical</sub></span> - <span class="nowrap">JD<sub>astronomical</sub></span> in units of days.<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#fn5">fn5</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>
    
<p>The oscillation seen in the figure is caused by the <i>p&#237;ngshu&#242;</i> rule, which only takes into account the mean motions of the Sun and Moon. On average, the calendrical conjunctions were 1.03 days later than the astronomical conjunctions from <span class="noqwrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to <span class="noqwrap">N<sub>-206</sub></span>. When the epoch was changed from A to B, the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i>s of the conjunctions were shortened by <span class="nowrap">144/940</span>, making the calendrical conjunctions about 0.15 days earlier. This was not enough to reduce the time lags of the calendrical conjunctions, but only temporarily delayed the increase of the time lags. When epoch B was changed to epoch C, the conjunction <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i>s were shortened by only <span class="nowrap">18/940</span>, which was too small to have a noticeable effect. As a result, the time lags are seen to increase steadily. The average time lag of the calendrical conjunctions was 1.20 days between 134 BCE and 129 BCE, and increased to 1.24 days after 110 BCE. The average values given here are very close to the values given in Zh&#257;ng's paper in 2007<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Zhang2007">Zhang07</a></sup>. The time lag was largely removed in the calendar reform in 104 BCE. Such serious time lags were impossible to miss and so the calendars were designed to behave this way.</p>
    
<p>In the book <i>On the Calendric System of the Qin and Early Han Dynasties</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Li2016">Li16</a></sup>, L&#464; Zh&#333;ngl&#237;n thinks that the calendar makers were strongly influenced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven" target="_blank">"mandate of heaven"</a> political doctrine. The epochs were chosen carefully to coincide with significant political events at the expense of reducing the discrepancies between the calendrical and astronomical conjunctions. For example, epoch A was in the year <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-360</sub></span>, which coincided with the year when Duke Xiao of Qin (秦孝公) became the ruler of the Qin state. During his reign, Duke Xiao employed the legalist statesman Shang Yang (商鞅) to carry out a series of ground breaking political, military and economic reforms, transforming Qin into a dominant superpower in the Warring States period. Epoch C was in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-205</sub></span>, which coincided with the year when Liu Bang  (劉邦), founder of the Han dynasty, attacked the Qin capital, leading to the surrendering of the Qin ruler and the collapse of the Qin dynasty.</p>
    
    <br />
<sect id="stermTable">Table of Solar Terms</sect>
    
<p>It is easy to calculate the dates of solar terms in the reconstructed calendar and their lunation fractions using the method described above. The table on <a href="QinHanSolarTerms.html">this page</a> lists the data for the solar terms Z10, Z11, Z12, J1 and Z1 from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>. As demonstrated in Example 1 in the Section 4, some years might not have Z10. The Z10 column refers to the Z10 that was closest to the New Year day. We can see that some of the Z10's occurred in post month 9 of the previous year.</p>
    
<p>The lunation fraction of a solar term increased by <span class="nowrap">7/19</span> (mod 1) every year and it repeated with a cycle of 19 years. This was not the case for the dates of solar terms in the Chinese calendar. Take the winter solstice (Z11) as an example. In example 1 in Section 4, we find that the lunation fraction of Z11 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> was <span class="nowrap">1163/74024</span> (&approx; <span class="nowrap">0.3/19</span>). This means that Z11 occurred <span class="nowrap">1163/74024</span> lunar cycles after the (month 11) conjunction. Using today's 24 hour system, Z11 occurred 11 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds after the conjunction. We find that the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the month 11 conjunction was 592 (denominator was 940), which means 15:06:54 using the 24-hour system. Adding 11 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds to the conjunction time yields 02:15 on the next day. So Z11 occurred on the second day of month 11 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>. 19 years after <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span> was <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-111</sub></span>. The lunation fraction of Z11 went through one cycle and returned to <span class="nowrap">1163/74024</span> again. So Z11 occurred 11 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds after the month 11 conjunction again. There were 235 months in 19 years. So the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the month 11 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-111</sub></span> was mod(592 + 235&times;499, 940) = 357 and the conjunction occurred at 09:06:54. Adding 11 hours 8 minutes and 6 seconds to the conjunction time yields 20:15. This means Z11 occurred on the same day as the month 11 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-111</sub></span>, which was not on the same day in the Chinese calendar as in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-130</sub></span>. This result is consistent with the dates of Z11 listed on <a href="QinHanSolarTerms.html">this page</a>. So the dates of a solar term in the Chinese calendar didn't repeat with a 19-year cycle. From the discussion of the <a href="guliuli.html#sifenSystem"><i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system</a>, we know that the cycle was 76 years (the <i>b&#249;</i> cycle). Since none of the epochs A, B, and C was used for more than 76 years, it is necessary to list the dates for all years from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>.</p>
    
<p>From the table on <a href="QinHanSolarTerms.html">this page</a>, we see that before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>, the dates of the winter solstice (Z11) were all in month 11 and all leap years coincided with the years in which the lunation fractions of Z11 (and Z12) were greater than <span class="nowrap">12/19</span>. After <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>, the leap month pattern was interrupted and the dates of Z11 were no longer fixed to month 11. Instead, the dates of Z12 were all in month 12 and the dates of Z1 were all in month 1. The leap years after <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span> coincided with the years in which the lunation fractions of Z1 were greater than <span class="nowrap">12/19</span>.</p>
    
<p>Even though the table on <a href="QinHanSolarTerms.html">this page</a> only lists a few solar terms. I have computed all 24 solar terms. I find that before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>, only the dates of Z11 were fixed to a month and the leap years only coincided with the years in which the lunation fractions of Z11 and Z12 were greater than <span class="nowrap">12/19</span>. After <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-162</sub></span>, only the dates of Z12 and Z1 were fixed to a month and the leap years only coincided with the years in which the lunation fractions of Z1 were greater than <span class="nowrap">12/19</span>. This information may provide an important clue to the intercalation rules used by the calendar systems from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>[<span class="ref">fn2</span>] I have not been able to figure out how the dates in his Table 10 are calculated. If I know the date and <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of any one of the conjunctions, I will be able to figure out the times of the other conjunctions using his adopted lunar cycle (29 + 663/1249) days. However, Table 10 only lists the sexagenary dates of the conjunctions but no information about the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i>s. This problem is not difficult to solve. Let's focus on the first conjunction in the table, which was on Nov. 13, 207 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar. The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the conjunction can take one of the 1249 possible values: 0, <span class="nowrap">1/1249</span>, <span class="nowrap">2/1249</span>, ..., <span class="nowrap">1248/1249</span>. There are 1262 conjunction dates between <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-205</sub></span> and <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-104</sub></span> listed in the table (omitting the last row for <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>). I can try these 1249 possible <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i>s one by one and see which one can produce the dates matching all of the listed 1262 dates. I wrote a simple computer code to carry out the calculation and found a unique solution: the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the first conjunction was <span class="nowrap">611/1249</span>. The <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> increases by 663 (mod 1249) each month. Since mod(611 + 195&times;663, 1249) = 0, the 196th conjunction in the table occurred at midnight. This conjunction occurred on Oct. 21, 191 BCE and its sexagenary day cycle was b&#464;ng x&#363;. This was the beginning of a <i>b&#249;</i> cycle. Like the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, a <i>b&#249;</i> cycle may be named after the sexagenary name of its first day. The problem is that the name b&#464;ng x&#363; is not one of the names listed in the paper. A <i>b&#249;</i> cycle in this system is 29&times;1249+663=36884 days. Since 36884&times;3=9221&times;12, the branch name of the <i>b&#249;</i> cycle repeats every 3 cycles. If x&#363; is a branch name, the other two names can only be w&#468; and y&#237;n, but the 3 possible branch names listed in the paper are z&#464;, sh&#275;n and ch&#233;n. Clearly b&#464;ng x&#363; is incompatible with the names given in the paper.<br />
If I assume that there are mistakes in Table 10, I could find a possible solution. The assumption is that the <i>xi&#462;oy&#250;</i> of the first conjunction is <span class="nowrap">613/1249</span>. If that is the case, there will be two mismatches when compared with the dates in Table 10: one is the month 5 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-136</sub></span>, and the other is the month 12 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-112</sub></span>. Interestingly, these two mismatched dates actually match the dates listed in <span class="ref">Li12</span>'s calendar table. Since mod(613+860&times;663, 1249) = 0, the 861st conjunction occurred at midnight. This conjunction turns out to be the month 5 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-136</sub></span>, one of the mismatched conjunction days. The sexagenary name of this conjunction day was changed from gu&#464; m&#462;o to ji&#462; ch&#233;n. Ji&#462; ch&#233;n is one of the names of the <i>b&#249;</i> cycles listed in the paper. Unlike the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, however, a <i>b&#249;</i> cycle is a cycle for the time of lunar conjunction returning to its starting value, not a cycle in which both the conjunction and a solar term returning to their original values. Using the <i>b&#249;</i> cycle 36884 days, I calculated the dates backward to see if there was any possible date on which a conjunction and a solar term both occurring at midnight that would result in the times of solar terms close to those of the Zhuanxu calendar. I found a possible epoch. It's at the time when J5 and conjunction were assumed to both occur at midnight on June 12, 6297 BCE (Julian day = <span class="nowrap">-578393.5</span>). The solar terms computed using this epoch are about 10 minutes earlier than those in the Zhuanxu calendar around 150 BCE. Since the adopted solar cycle is slightly shorter than that in the <i>s&#236;f&#275;n</i> system, the times of solar terms calculated using this epoch are about 15 minutes later than those in the Zhuanxu calendar around 206 BCE and about 30 minutes earlier around 104 BCE. Are the data in Table 10 computed using this epoch? Are there really mistakes in Table 10?</p></li>
    
<li id="fn3"><p>[<span class="ref">fn3</span>] Using Epoch B in <span class="ref">Li12</span>, one can easily find that the sexagenary date of the month 5 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-199</sub></span> was j&#464; m&#462;o, but it is also easy to see that the listed j&#464; s&#236; is wrong and j&#464; m&#462;o is correct from his calendar table. According to his calendar table, the sexagenary dates of the month 4 and month 6 conjunction days in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-199</sub></span> were both j&#464; y&#466;u, which means that there were 60 days between month 4 and month 6 conjunctions. This is possible only if both month 4 and month 5 had 30 days. Thus, the sexagenary date of month 5 conjunction was 30 days after j&#464; y&#466;u, which was j&#464; m&#462;o.</p></li>
    
<li id="fn4"><p>[<span class="ref">fn4</span>] The calendar data in <i>3500 Years of Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i> are based on: the Zhuanxu calendar before <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-215</sub></span>, the author's reconstructed Han calendar based on the <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-133</sub></span> data<sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Zhang1978">Zhang78</a></sup> from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-215</sub></span> to month 12 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, and the T&#224;ich&#363; astronomical system beginning in month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>. The book does not provide this information. I deduce it by comparing the data in the book and data in the author's another book <i>Tables of Chinese Calendars in the Pre-Qin Period</i><sup><a href="QinHanCalendars.html#Zhang1987">Zhang87</a></sup>. In <i>3500 Years of Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i>, two consecutive short months appear in month 12 and month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>. This is impossible under the <i>p&#237;ngshu&#242;</i> rule (based on the mean motions of the Moon and Sun), but is easily explained by the change of calendar in month 1.</p></li>
    
<li id="fn5"><p>[<span class="ref">fn5</span>] Astronomical conjunctions are calculated by the modern method. That is the method described in <a href="docs/sunMoon.pdf">this pdf document</a>, but precession has to be calculated using the Vondr&#225;k et. al. precession model described in Section 7.2 of the document. The computed TDB times are then converted to UT1 using the method described in Section 8 of the document. Julian days <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>i</sub>)</span> of the calendrical conjunctions are calculated using equation (3) above. The resulting times are regarded as the local time. The capitals of Qin and Early Han dynasties were both close to the present-day city Xi'an. The longitude of Xi'an is 108.9&deg;E. Hence the local time of the capitals was (108.9/15) hours = 0.3025 days ahead of UT1. Subtracting 0.3025 from <span class="nowrap">JD(M<sub>i</sub>)</span> results in Julian day in UT1. Subtracting the UT1 Julian day of an astronomical conjunction from the UT1 Julian day of the corresponding calendrical conjunction gives the time lag. There were 1764 lunar conjunctions between the month 10 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> and month 4 conjunction in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>. Figure 1 was produced using these 1764 data points.</p></li>
